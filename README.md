# NBA Power Rankings

Creating my own NBA power rankings system taking inspiration from an [NRL](https://fanalytics.weebly.com/) and [Football](http://www.eloratings.net/) power ranking system. My own and both of these systems are based on Arpad Elo's Elo ranking system used to rate chess players.

The Elo ranking system is based on the following formula:

$$\text{R}_n = \text{R}_o + \text{K} \times (\text{W} - \text{W}_e)$$

The following is my little diary containing thoughts and processes during development. Some terms to be aware of:
|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|PR|Power Ranking|
|OT|Over Time|
