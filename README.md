# NBA Elo Rankings

Creating my own NBA Elo rankings system taking inspiration from the [NRL](https://fanalytics.weebly.com/), [Football](http://www.eloratings.net/), and [FiveThirtyEight's](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/) Elo ranking system. All these systems are based on Arpad Elo's Elo ranking system used to rate chess players.

The Elo ranking system is based on the following formula:

$$\text{R}_n = \text{R}_o + \text{K} \times (\text{W} - \text{W}_e)$$

There are better NBA Elo rankings out there but I just wanted to make my own as a project to work on and try implement things I've learnt at university.

I have a [diary](diary.md) with thoughts and processes on the development of this project. It's a bit informal and rambly but I hope it provides some insight on the process.
